# MI3-project-1

## Section 1: Software and Platforms
### The Project used Python as the programming language
### The project used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) as an add-on library for sentiment analysis, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, numpy to create large arrays, and matplotlib for plotting. 
### The project was conducted on using Google Colab, cloud-based platform provided by Google 

## Section 2: Map of Documentation
### The repository contains a README file (this file), a LICENSE.md file, and three folders: SCRIPTS, DATA, OUTPUT 
### DATA Folder contains directions to access the two raw datasets used for analyzed
  #### Data Appendix File: includes text that was typed, as well as tables, figures, and other descriptive statistics
  #### Obtain the Data File: includes the instructions on how to get access to the data sets we used in our analysis
### SCRIPTS Folder contains the script file used to process, manipulate, and analyse the raw datasets
  #### DS_4002_Proj1_SentimentAnalysis File: includes all code, from wrangling, exploratory analysis, and output
### OUTPUT Folder contains the output graphs generated from the script
  #### Exploratory_Graph_Number_of_Reviews File
  #### Output_Graph_Visualization_of_Critic_Sentiment File

## Section 3: Instructions to Reproduce Results
### Obtain Data
#### From the DATA folder, download the document called "Obtain the Data" and follow its directions to obtain the two CSV files used for analysis. 
### Run script to conduct analysis 
#### From the SCRIPT folder, download the Ipython Notebook called "DS4002_Group11_Proj1_SentimentAnalysis.ipynb". Once downloaded, decide to either (option 1) run the file locally using Jupyter Notebook or (option 2) upload the file to Google Drive to run it using Google Colab. In both cases, the filepath information in the second cell under the "Import Data" header must be updated in the ipynb to match the location where the two CSV files are saved. Additionally, if the script is run locally through Jupyter, the first cell under the "Import Data" should be deleted as it is unnecessary. Once those changes are made, each cell in the script should be run once sequentially to produce the outputs seen in the OUTPUT folder of this repository.
